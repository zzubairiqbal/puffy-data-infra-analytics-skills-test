# AI usage note

I used AI tools as a productivity assistant while completing this assignment. Specifically:
- generating small code snippets/boilerplate (e.g., parsing helpers, CLI argument wiring), validating and peer reviewing code and structuring code
- proofreading and tightening documentation wording and related documentation.
- and quickly exploring alternative implementation options, available best practices

The overall design, what to validate, the severity rules, session and attribution definitions, the reconciliation checks, and the business conclusions were driven by my own judgment. I treated AI as a helper for speed, not as a source of decisions, and I verified outputs by running the pipeline end‑to‑end on the provided dataset and reconciling key totals.
